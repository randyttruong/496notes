# COMP_SCI 496: Graduate Algorithms Notes 
These are my notes for the "Graduate Algorithms" course offered at NU. 

## Description 
This is a repo because it's just more effective for me to type my notes out 
instead of just writing them down. A lot of the workflow here comes from 
writing things down in class, scribing them in Typst, then doing 
more studying in order to better understand the material lol. 

## Topic List 
TODO 

## Additional funsies 
Because I don't know that much about math, I also examined 
the following books in order to get myself up to speed 
in combinatorics, probability, and probabilistic methods 
in combinatorics. 

- `A Walk Through Combinatorics` by Miklos Bona 
- `The Probabilistic Method` by Joel Spencer and Noga Alon 
- `Probability and Computing` by Michael Mitzenmacher
